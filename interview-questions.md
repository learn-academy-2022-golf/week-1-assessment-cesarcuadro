# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is the software on the local machine that tracks changes to whatever coding you do to a file. The difference between git and Github is that git is on your local machine while Github is a cloud based software based in Idaho that shows what changes were made.

Researched answer: Git is an open sourced, cloud based software that is used for sharing and working collaboratively on the same code base. Git is accessed on the command line on your computer. Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration that uses Git.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The JavaScript operators that will return a boolean value are logical operators, relational operators, and equality operators.

Researched answer: Boolean expressions in JavaScript return true or false. JavaScript operators that will return a boolean value are equality operators, relational operators, and logical operators.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the location of data in either a string or an array. The difference between an index and a value is that an index is the location of the value while the value is what represents the data or information.

Researched answer: An index contains the position of a regular expression that matches within a string. A value is the content of each element in an array that must be a JavaScript data type.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are represented by square brackets and inside the square brackets are elements that must be a data type. Arrays also have mutators and accessors. Strings are represented by quotation marks that usually have single or a set of characters in between the quotation marks. Strings have built-in methods. Arrays can hold strings inside of them, both can be represented by a variable and are zero indexed. 

Researched answer: An array is a collection of ordered data that can contain any type of information as long as it is a data type that JavaScript recognizes. Strings are a collection of characters inside of quotation marks.

1. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is a method of programming that uses two or more people in order to increase the efficiency and understanding of all parties involved. There are two roles, the driver and navigator. The driver is the one that is typing the code inside of the file while the navigator is guiding and verifying what the driver is doing.

Researched answer: The driver uses the keyboard and mouse. The navigator is watching, advising, thinking, is responsible for higher-level input to the code, and catches errors, bugs, and typos.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions are a built in method that JavaScript uses to take in a function as an argument that often operate on arrays. They are most useful for iteration.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that helps facilitate test driven development.

3. Objects: Objects can contain data, methods, and be used for destructuring. Objects usually consist of key:value pairs wrapped inside curly braces. They can also contain functions that in turn can be used as methods. The destructuring assignment for objects is a special way of assigning variables.

4. Method: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. 

5. Classes: Classes contain data and behavior. Classes are the blueprints of objects and have their own scope.
